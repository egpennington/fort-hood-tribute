               led to implementation of the Selective Service System shortly before World War I.</p><br>

                it may be necessary to meet the forces of wrong." - Col Leonard Wood</em></blockquote><br>
            <li><strong>1913</strong> - Commander of the Army's Eastern Department</li>
            <li><strong>1915</strong> - published as a pro-preparedness book, The Military Obligation of Citizenship</li>

            <p> After the war, Wood was appointed to command the Sixth Corps Area, which he led from 1919 to 1921.</p>
            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Retired from the U.S. Army</li>

            <p>The successful removal of Wood's first brain tumor in 1910 represented an important milestone, indicating to the public the advances
               that had been made in the nascent field of neurosurgery, and extending Wood's life by almost two decades.  His brain is held at the
               Yale University School of Medicine as part of an historic collection of Harvey Cushing's patients' preserved brains.</p>
            <li><strong>1940</strong> - Fort Leonard Wood named in his honor</li>
            <p>Also one of the U.S. Navy's World War II-era Harris-class attack transports, USS Leonard Wood (APA-12), was named for Wood.</p>
